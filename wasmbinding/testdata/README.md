# Stub test contract

This folder contains a bogus test contract which just exposes public api from
an example contract from babylon bindings repo - https://github.com/babylonchain/bindings/tree/main/contracts/example

This approach enables us to specify which branch from the bindings library we want to test/use.

Until custom babylon api is stable this approach enables faster iteration than publishing
wasm blobs from the bindings library directly.


## Artifacts

We are storing the current version of artifacts in repo to speed up the CI.
In principle, we could use a rust-optimizer in each run to build contracts from sources but it would take a longer
time.
The downside of this approach is that with each update of `Cargo.toml` or `lib.rs` file
wasm blobs should be regenerated by running `make build-test-wasm` command
